  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Users upload files to specific cases using a secret key. Admins can create and manage cases, 
    which are mapped to Azure Blob Storage containers. Files are compressed and secured with a password before being stored.
    The system ensures secure file storage and metadata management using Azure services.
